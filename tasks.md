## Notes for the Coding LLM

1. **Start with Phase 1-2** to get a working backend that can be tested with Postman
2. **Phase 3-4** creates a minimal but functional UI
3. **Complete each phase fully** before moving to the next
4. **Test each task** as indicated before marking it complete
5. **Weighted price formula**: `weighted_price = kamerastore_price * (0.2 + ((mechanical_status + cosmetic_status) / 2 - 1) * 0.2)`
6. **Use console.log** liberally during development for debugging
7. **Commit after each phase** for easy rollback if needed
8. **Skip authentication** - this is a personal use application
9. **Keep the UI simple** - functionality over fancy features
10. **If stuck**, implement a simpler version first, then enhance
